# Why tidyverse?

# Tidyverse packages

### Loading the tidyverse

```{r tverse, cache = FALSE}
library(tidymodels)
```

--

- We see that we have actually loaded a number of packages (which could also be loaded individually), some crucial ones: `recipe`, `parsnip`, `workflows`, 'yardstick' etc.


---

# Key functions of tidymodeling


broom: takes the messy output of built-in functions in R, such as lm, nls, or t.test, and turns them into tidy data frames.
dials: has tools to create and manage values of tuning parameters.
dplyr: contains a grammar for data manipulation.
ggplot2: implements a grammar of graphics.
infer: is a modern approach to statistical inference.
parsnip: is a tidy, unified interface to creating models.
purrr: is a functional programming toolkit.
recipe: is a general data preprocessor with a modern interface. It can create model matrices that incorporate feature engineering, imputation, and other help tools.
rsample: has infrastructure for resampling data so that models can be assessed and empirically validated.
tibble: has a modern re-imagining of the data frame.
tune: contains the functions to optimize model hyper-parameters.
workflows: has methods to combine pre-processing steps and models into a single object.
yardstick: contains tools for evaluating models (e.g.accuracy, RMSE, etc.).




- In addition to the currently core tidymodels packages.... usage.<sup>1</sup>
- See [here](https://www.tidymodels.org/find/) for a list of all tidymodels functions across different CRAN packages can be found at, or just in R directly:

```{r tverse_pkgs}
tidymodels_packages()
```

.footnote[

--

- We'll use several of these additional packages during the remainder of this course (e.g., the `lubridate` package for working with dates and the `rvest` package for web scraping).
- However, bear in mind that these packages will have to be loaded separately.

# The tidyverse philosophy

### Key philosophy for tidy data

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

Basically, tidy data is more likely to be [long (i.e. narrow) format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data) than wide format.

--

### More unifying principles

- Today, the tidyverse stands for more than just "tidy data".
- It is guided by the principles of being **human centered**, **consistent**, **composable**, and **inclusive**.
- We will learn about these [unifying principles](https://design.tidyverse.org/unifying.html) inductively when working with more and more tidyverse packages.
- Later today, we will learn about [tidyverse style principles](https://style.tidyverse.org/) of low-level code formatting.

--

### Resources

Check out the [tidyverse design guide](https://design.tidyverse.org/) for a comprehensive treatment of the tidyverse philosophy.

# Tidyverse vs. base R

<div align="center">
<img src="pics/great-story-base-R.jpeg" width=700>
</div>


---

# Tidyverse vs. base R: what's the difference?

- Both are compatible. You can wrangle your data with `dplyr`, plot it with `ggplot2`, and model it with yet another package.
- Ultimately, the tidyverse is just a bunch of (hugely popular!) packages that share design principles.
- Often, tidyverse packages don't reinvent the wheel. Instead, they offer more consistency in naming, arguments, and output (among other things).
- For instance, compare function naming principles (`tidyverse::snake_case` vs `base::period.case` rule; more on these conventions later) in these examples:

| tidyverse  |  base |
|---|---|
| `?readr::read_csv`  | `?utils::read.csv` |
|  `?dplyr::if_else` |  `?base::ifelse` |
|  `?tibble::tibble` |  `?base::data.frame` |

- If you call up the above examples, you'll see that the tidyverse alternative typically offers some enhancements or other useful options (and sometimes restrictions) over its base counterpart.

--

- And **remember:** There are (almost) always multiple ways to achieve a single goal in R.

# Tidyverse vs. base R: what to use?

.pull-left[
### Stories from the past

- When I started to learn R ~14 years ago, there was no tidyverse. The learning curve felt much steeper. I often switched back to Stata for data wrangling.
- As the tidyverse grew, R became more convenient to use for the entire research pipeline.
- There's simply no need for you to live through the same pain.

### Why we start with the tidyverse

- Because [clever people think it's the right way](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/).
- Documentation + community support are great.
- Having a consistent syntax makes it easier to learn.
]

--

.pull-right[

### You still will want to check out base R alternatives later

- Base R is extremely flexible and powerful (and stable).
- There are some things that you'll have to venture outside of the tidyverse for.
- A combination of tidyverse and base R is often the best solution to a problem.
- Excellent base R data manipulation tutorials: [here](https://www.rspatial.org/intr/index.html) and [here](https://github.com/matloff/fasteR).

# The beauty of pipes

### A simple but powerful tool

- The forward-pipe operator `%>%` pipes the left-hand side values forward into expressions on the right-hand side.
- We replace `f(x)` with `x %>% f()`.

--

### Why piping is cool

- It structures sequences of data operations as pipes, i.e. left-to-right (as opposed to from the inside and out).
- It serves the natural way of reading ("do this, then this, then this, ...").
- It avoids nested function calls.
- It improves cognitive performance of code writers and readers.
- It minimizes the need for local variables and function definitions.

--

### Background

- The pipe was originally created in 2014 by [Stefan Milton Bache](https://stefanbache.dk/) and published with the [`magrittr`](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/) package.
- Magrittr? [Get it?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images) 🤡
- The basics come with the tidyverse by default, but `magrittr` can do more (watch out for the ["tee" pipe](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/tee.html), `%T>%`, the ["exposition" pipe](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/exposition.html), `%$%`, and the ["assignment" pipe](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/compound.html), `%<>%`). Also, be sure to check out [aliases](https://rdrr.io/cran/magrittr/man/aliases.html).


---

# Piping etiquette

### When to avoid the pipe

- Pipes are not very handy when you need to manipulate more than one object at a time. Reserve pipes for a sequence of steps applied to one primary object.
- Don't use the pipe when there are meaningful intermediate objects that can be given informative names (and that are used later on).

--

### Instead, here's how to use it

- `%>%` should always have a space before it, and should usually be followed by a new line.
- A one-step pipe can stay on one line, but unless you plan to expand it later on, you should consider rewriting it to a regular function call.
- `magrittr` allows you to omit `()` on functions that don't have arguments (as in `mydata %>% summary`). Avoid this feature.

---



--

- Here's how it works:

```r
mtcars |> subset(cyl == 4) |> head()
mtcars |> subset(cyl == 4) |> (\(x) lm(mpg ~ disp, data = x))()
```

.footnote[<sup>1</sup> That's actually a `|` followed by a `>`. The default font on these slides just makes it look extra fancy.]

# Key dplyr verbs

.pull-left-wide[
There are five key `dplyr` verbs that you need to learn.<sup>1</sup>

1. `filter()`: Filter (i.e. subset) rows based on their values.

2. `arrange()`: Arrange (i.e. reorder) rows based on their values.

3. `select()`: Select (i.e. subset) columns by their names.

4. `mutate()`: Create new columns.

5. `summarize()`: Collapse multiple rows into a single summary value.<sup>2</sup>

But let's start with studying the key commands using the `starwars` dataset that comes pre-packaged with `dplyr`. 

]


.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> There is much, much more in `dplyr`, and we will look beyond these core functions later. Have a glimpse at the [overview at tidyverse.org](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and at this excellent [cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-transformation.pdf).
</br>
<sup>2</sup> `summarize()` with an "s" works too. I slightly prefer the barbarian version though.

]



---
name: filter

# 1) dplyr::filter()

We can chain multiple filter commands with the pipe (`%>%`), or just separate them within a single filter command using commas.

```{r filter1}
starwars %>% 
  filter( 
    species == "Human", 
    height >= 190
    ) 
```

---

# 1) dplyr::filter() *cont.*

Regular expressions work well, too.
```{r filter2}
starwars %>% 
  filter(stringr::str_detect(name, "Skywalker"))
```

---

# 1) dplyr::filter() *cont.*

A very common `filter()` use case is identifying (or removing) missing data cases. 
```{r filter3}
starwars %>% 
  filter(is.na(height))
```

--

To remove missing observations, simply use negation: `filter(!is.na(height))`.


---

# 1) dplyr::filter() *cont.*

Importantly, when we list several filter conditions, `filter()` interprets them as a Boolean "AND". 

```{r filter4}
starwars %>% 
  filter(str_detect(name, "Skywalker"), 
                    eye_color == "blue")
```

--

We can work with operators `|` ("OR") and `&` ("AND") and combine them with parentheses to specify more complex filter commands, as in:

```{r filter5, eval = FALSE}
starwars %>% 
  filter(species == "Wookiee" | (species == "Human" & height >= 200))
```


---

# 2) dplyr::arrange()

`arrange()` sorts observations in increasing order by default.

```{r arrange1}
starwars %>% 
  arrange(birth_year)
```

--

*Note:* Arranging on a character-based column (i.e. strings) will sort alphabetically.

---

# 2) dplyr::arrange() *cont.*

We can also arrange items in descending order using `arrange(desc())`.

```{r arrange2}
starwars %>% 
  arrange(desc(birth_year))
```

---
name: select

# 3) dplyr::select()

Use commas to select multiple columns out of a data frame. (You can also use `<first>:<last>` for consecutive columns). Deselect a column with "-".

```{r select1}
starwars %>% 
  select(name:skin_color, species, -height)
```

---

# 3) dplyr::select() *cont.*

You can also rename some (or all) of your selected variables in place.
```{r select2}
starwars %>%
  select(alias = name, crib = homeworld, sex = gender) 
```

--

If you just want to rename columns without subsetting them, you can use `rename()`.

---

# 3) dplyr::select() *cont.*

The `select(contains(<PATTERN>))` option provides a nice shortcut in relevant cases.
```{r select3}
starwars %>% 
  select(name, contains("color"))
```

--

There are many more useful selection helpers, such as `starts_with()`, `ends_with()`, and `matches()`. See [here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html) for an overview.

---

# 3) dplyr::select() *cont.*

The `select(..., everything())` option is another useful shortcut if you only want to bring some variable(s) to the "front" of a data frame.

```{r select4}
starwars %>% 
  select(species, homeworld, everything()) %>%
  head(5)
```

--

</br>
*Note:* The new `relocate()` function available in dplyr 1.0.0 has brought a lot more functionality to the ordering of columns. See [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/03/dplyr-1-0-0-select-rename-relocate/).


---

# 4) dplyr::mutate()

You can create new columns from scratch with `mutate()`, or (more commonly) as transformations of existing columns.

```{r mutate2}
starwars %>% 
  select(name, birth_year) %>%
  mutate(
    dog_years = birth_year * 7, ## Separate with a comma
    comment = paste0(name, " is ", dog_years, " in dog years.")
    ) %>%
  slice(1:6) # Just show first six observations
```

--

*Note:* `mutate()` is order aware. So you can chain multiple mutates in a single call.

---

# 4) dplyr::mutate() *cont.*

Boolean, logical and conditional operators all work well with `mutate()` too.
```{r mutate3}
starwars %>% 
  select(name, height) %>%
  filter(name %in% c("Luke Skywalker", "Anakin Skywalker")) %>% 
  mutate(tall1 = height > 180) %>%
  mutate(tall2 = ifelse(height > 180, "Tall", "Short")) ## Same effect, but can choose labels

```

---

# 4) dplyr::mutate() *cont.*

Lastly, combining `mutate()` with the `across()` feature allows you to easily work on a subset of variables. For example:

```{r, mutate4}
starwars %>% 
  select(name:eye_color) %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.character), toupper)) %>% #<< 
  head(5)
```

--

</br>
*Note:* More on `across()` and `where()` later!

---
name: summarize

# 5) dplyr::summarize()

You can summarize variables with all sorts of operations (e.g., `mean()`, `median()`, `n()`, `n_distinct()`, `sum()`, `first()`, `last()`, ...).

```{r summ1}
starwars %>% 
  group_by(species, gender) %>% 
  summarize(mean_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  head(5)
```

--

*Note:* This is particularly useful in combination with the `group_by()` command. Again, more on this later!


---

# 5) dplyr::summarize() *cont.*

You can also calculate grouped summary statistics using an alternate approach of passing the groups directly to the `summarize()` call using a `.by` argument. 



```{r summ2}
starwars %>% 
  summarize(mean_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE), .by = c(species, gender)) %>%
  head(5)
```

--

Read more about both these approaches and the difference in outputs [here](https://r4ds.hadley.nz).


---

# 5) dplyr::summarize() *cont.*

Note that including `na.rm = TRUE` is usually a good idea with the functions fed into `summarize()`. Otherwise, any missing value will propagate to the summarized value too.

```{r summ3}
## Probably not what we want
starwars %>% 
  summarize(mean_height = mean(height))
## Much better
starwars %>% 
  summarize(mean_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---

# 5) dplyr::summarize() *cont.*

The same `across()`-based workflow that we saw with `mutate()` a few slides back also works with `summarize()`. For example:

```{r, summ4}
starwars %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(across(where(is.numeric), mean, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  head(5)
```


---

# Grouping with dplyr::group_by()

With `group_by()`, you can create a "grouped" copy of a table grouped by unique values of a column. If multiple columns are specified, the function groups by all available combinations of values.

```{r, groupby1}
by_species_gender <- starwars %>% group_by(species, gender) 
by_species_gender
```

---

# Grouping with dplyr::group_by() *cont.*

.pull-left[
### More notes on grouping

- Grouping doesn't change how the data looks (apart from listing how it's grouped).
- Grouping changes how it acts with other dplyr verbs such as `summarize()` and `mutate()`, as we've already seen.
- By default, `group_by()` overrides existing grouping. Use `.add = TRUE` to append instead.
- By default, groups formed by factor levels that don't appear in the data are dropped. Set `.drop = FALSE` if you want to keep them.
- `ungroup()` removes existing grouping.
- `dplyr` notifies you about grouping variables every time you do operations on or with them. If you find these messages annoying, [switch them off](https://twitter.com/MattCowgill/status/1278463099272491008) with `options(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE)`.

```{r, groupby2}

by_species_gender %>% 
  summarize(mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  filter(n_distinct(gender) ==2)
```
]

---

# Other dplyr goodies

--

`slice()`: Subset rows by position rather than filtering by values. There's also `slice_sample()` to randomly select rows, `slice_head()` and `slice_tail()`to select first or last rows, and more.

```{r}
starwars %>% slice(c(1, 5))
```

--

`pull()`: Extract a column from as a data frame as a vector or scalar.

```{r}
starwars %>% filter(gender=="feminine") %>% pull(height)
```

---

# Other dplyr goodies *cont.*

`count()` and `distinct()`: Number and isolate unique observations.

```{r}
starwars %>% count(species) %>% head(6)
starwars %>% distinct(species) %>% pull() %>% sort() %>% magrittr::extract(1:5) 
```

--

You could also use a combination of `mutate()`, `group_by()`, and `n()`, e.g. `starwars %>% group_by(species) %>% mutate(num = n())`.

---

# Other dplyr goodies *cont.*

`where()`: Select the variables for which a function returns true.

```{r}
starwars %>% select(where(is.numeric)) %>% names()
```

--

`across()`: Summarize or mutate multiple variables in the same way. More information [here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/across.html).

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), scale)) %>% 
  head(3)
```


---

# Other dplyr goodies *cont.*

`case_when()`: Vectorize multiple `if_else()` (or base R `ifelse()`) statements.

```{r}
starwars %>% 
  mutate( 
    height_cat = case_when(
      height < 160 ~ "tiny",
      height >= 160 & height < 190 ~ "medium",
      height >= 190 & height < 220 ~ "tall",
      height >= 220 ~ "giant"
    )
  ) %>%
  pull(height_cat) %>% table()
```

--

There are also a whole class of [window functions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/window-functions.html) for getting leads and lags, ranking, creating cumulative aggregates, etc. See `vignette("window-functions")`.

--

`inner_join()`, `left_join()`, `right_join()`: Enough already, we'll talk about this in the session on databases!

# Key tidyr verbs

.pull-left-wide[

`tidyr` is part of the core tidyverse. There are four key `tidyr` verbs that you need to learn.

1. `pivot_longer()`: Pivot wide data into long format (i.e. "melt").<sup>1</sup> 

2. `pivot_wider()`: Pivot long data into wide format (i.e. "cast").<sup>2</sup> 

3. `separate()`: Separate (i.e. split) one column into multiple columns. <sup>3</sup> 

4. `unite()`: Unite (i.e. combine) multiple columns into one.

.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> Updated version of `tidyr::gather()`.

<sup>2</sup> Updated version of `tidyr::spread()`.

<sup>3</sup> Updated versions: `separate_wider_delim()` and `separate_wider_position()`.

# On "longer" and "wider" datasets

.pull-left-wide[
Remember the **key philosophy for tidy data**?

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

One of the most common tasks for data scientists is to **reshape** data from one form to the other. 

There are **multiple ways to store the same data in a dataset** (or across multiple tables; but more on that in the session on databases).

Here, we learn how to shift between 
- **"wider"** formats, i.e. data being stored across more columns and
- **"longer"** formats, i.e. data being stored across more rows.

# From wide to long to wide

.pull-left-wide[

### From wider to longer

- `pivot_longer()` pivots `cols` columns, moving column names into a `names_to` column, and column values into a `values_to` column.
- Recall a panel study design with multiple observations per unit.
- In the classical long format, each row represents one observation.
- Note how this is approaching the ideal of **tidy data**.

### From longer to wider

- `pivot_wider()` pivots a `names_from` and a `values_from` column into a rectangular field of cells.
- In a panel study design, this would allow you to have one variable per measurement (e.g., pre- and posttreatment outcome variable).
- While this is nice for the human eye, it is sometimes not what fits the tidyverse workflow. Also, wenn you have multiple repeated measurements (think: variables in a population survey), the number of columns is quickly inflated. Be ready to `pivot_longer()`.

# 1) tidyr::pivot_longer()

```{r pivot_longer1a}
stocks = data.frame( ## Could use "tibble" instead of "data.frame" if you prefer
  time = as.Date('2009-01-01') + 0:1,
  X = rnorm(2, 0, 1),
  Y = rnorm(2, 0, 2),
  Z = rnorm(2, 0, 4)
  )
stocks
```

--

```{r pivot_longer1b}
tidy_stocks <- stocks %>% pivot_longer(-time, names_to = "stock", values_to = "price")
tidy_stocks
```


---
name: pivotwider

# 2) tidyr::pivot_wider()

```{r pivot_wider1a, eval = FALSE}
tidy_stocks %>% pivot_wider(names_from = stock, values_from = price)
```

--

```{r pivot_wider1b, eval = FALSE}
tidy_stocks %>% pivot_wider(names_from = time, values_from = price)
```

--

</br>
*Note:* The second example &mdash; which has combined different pivoting arguments &mdash; has effectively transposed the data.



---
name: separate

# 3) tidyr::separate()

Sometimes, cell values provide information that should be stored in separate columns. `separate()` offers one way of doing this. (*Side note*: Once you learn regular expressions, you will have an even more powerful tool for this task.)

```{r sep1a}
economists = data.frame(name = c("Adam.Smith", "Paul.Samuelson", "Milton.Friedman"))
economists
```

--

`separate()` in action: 

```{r sep1b}
economists %>% separate(name, c("first_name", "last_name")) 
```

--

You can also specify the separation character with `separate(..., sep=".")`. The way `sep` works also depends on column typ (character vs. numberic). Check out the [function reference](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/separate.html).


---


# 3) tidyr::separate() *cont.*

The same can also be achieve using new syntax wherein the uses of `separate()` are more obvious, the API is more polished, and the handling of problems is better.. When we have a clear separation character, we can use `separate_wider_delim` that splits using a delimiter:

```{r sep2a}
economists %>%
  separate_wider_delim(
    cols = name,
    delim = ".",
    names = c("first_name", "last_name")
  )
```

---

# 3) tidyr::separate() *cont.*

When we want to separate at fixed widths, where the positions of characters are consistent, we can `separate_wider_position`: 

```{r sep3a}
economists$attribute <- c("m-34", "m-23", "f-38")
economists
economists %>%
  separate_wider_position(attribute, c(sex = 1, 1, age = 2) 
    )
```

--

---

# 3) tidyr::separate() *cont.*

A related function is `separate_rows()`, for splitting up cells that contain multiple fields or observations (a frustratingly common occurence with survey data).

```{r sep4a}
jobs = data.frame(
  name = c("Jack", "Jill"),
  occupation = c("Homemaker", "Philosopher, Philanthropist, Troublemaker") 
  ) 
jobs
```

--

`separate_rows()` in action: 

```{r sep4b}
jobs %>% separate_rows(occupation)
```


---
name: unite

# 4) tidyr::unite()

`separate()` has a complementary function, `unite()`. Unsurprinsingly, it unites values from multiple columns into one.

```{r unite1}
gdp = data.frame(
  yr = rep(2016, times = 3),
  mnth = rep(1, times = 3),
  dy = 1:3,
  gdp = rnorm(3, mean = 100, sd = 2)
  )
gdp 
## Combine "yr", "mnth", and "dy" into one "date" column
gdp %>% unite(date, c("yr", "mnth", "dy"), sep = "-")
```

---

# 4) tidyr::unite() *cont.*

.pull-left[
Note that `unite()` will automatically create a character variable. You can see this better if we convert it to a tibble. 
```{r unite2}
gdp_u = gdp %>% 
  unite(date, 
        c("yr", "mnth", "dy"), 
        sep = "-") %>% 
  as_tibble()
gdp_u
```
]

--

.pull-right[
If you want to convert it to something else (e.g. date or numeric) then you will need to modify it using `mutate()`. See below for an example, using the [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) package's super helpful date conversion functions.

```{r unite3, message=F}
library(lubridate)
gdp_u %>% mutate(date = ymd(date))
```
]

# Other tidyr goodies

`crossing()`: Get the full combination of a group of variables.<sup>1</sup>

```{r cross1}
crossing(side=c("left", "right"), height=c("top", "bottom"))
```

.footnote[
<sup>1</sup> See `?expand()` and `?complete()` for more specialized functions that allow you to fill in (implicit) missing data or variable combinations in existing data frames. Base R alternative: `expand.grid()`.
]  

--

`drop_na(data, ...)`: Drop rows containing NAs in `...` columns.

--

`fill(data, ..., direction = c("down", "up"))`: Fill in NAs in `...` columns with most recent non-NA values.

# Coding style: the basics

### Why adhere to a particular style of coding?

- It reduces the number of arbitrary decisions you have to consciously make during coding. We make an arbitrary decision (convention) once, not always ad hoc.
- It provides consistency.
- It makes code easier to write.
- It makes code easier to read, especially in the long term (i.e. two days after you've closed a script).
	
--

### What are questions of style?

- Questions of style are a matter of opinion.
- We will mostly follow Hadley Wickham’s opinion as expressed in the "[tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)".
- We'll consider how to
  - name,
  - comment,
  - structure, and
  - write.

# Naming files

- Code file names should be meaningful and end in `.R`.
- Avoid using special characters in file names. Stick with numbers, letters, dashes (`-`), and underscores (`_`).
- Some examples:

```bash
# Good
fit_models.R
utility_functions.R

# Bad
fit models.R
foo.r
stuff.r
```

- If files should be run in a particular order, prefix them with numbers: 

```bash
00_download.R
01_explore.R
...
09_model.R
10_visualize.R
```

# Naming objects and variables

.pull-left[
- There are various conventions of how to write phrases without spaces or punctuation. Some of these have been adapted in programming, such as [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case), [PascalCase](https://techterms.com/definition/pascalcase), or [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case).
- The [`tidyverse`](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#object-names) way: Object and variable names should use only lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores.
- Examples:

```bash
# Good
day_one # snake_case
day_1 # snake_case

# Less good
dayOne # camelCase
DayOne # PascalCase
day.one # dot.case

# Dysfunctional
day-one # kebab-case
```

# Naming functions

- In addition to following the general advice for object names, strive to use verbs for function names:

```bash
# Good
add_row()
permute()

# Bad
row_adder()
permutation()
```
- Also, try avoiding function names that already exist, in particular those that come with a loaded package.
- This often implies a trade-off between shortness and uniqueness. In any case, you would try to avoid situations that force you disambiguate functions with the same name (as in `dplyr::select`; see ["R packages"](https://r-pkgs.org/dependencies-mindset-background.html#sec-dependencies-namespace)).
- Check out this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)) or this [Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17326185/what-are-the-different-kinds-of-cases) for more background on naming conventions in programming!
- For more good advice on how to name stuff, see [this legendary presentation](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~rcs46/lectures_2015/01-markdown-git/slides/naming-slides/naming-slides.pdf) by Jenny Bryan.

# Commenting on things

.pull-left[

### Why comment at all?

- It’s often tempting to set up a project assuming that you will be the only person working on it, e.g. as homework. But that's almost never true. 
- You have project partners, co-authors, principals.
- Even if not, there's someone else who you always have to keep happy: Future-you.
- Comment often to make Future-you happy about Past-you by document what Present-You is doing/thinking/planning to do.

# Commenting on things *cont.*

.pull-left[
### General advice

- Each line of a comment should begin with the comment symbol and a single space: `# `
- Use comments to record important findings and analysis decisions.
- If you need comments to explain what your code is doing, consider rewriting your code to be clearer. 
- But: comments can work well as "sub-headlines".
- If you discover that you have more comments than code, consider switching to R Markdown.
- (Longer) comments generally work better if they get their own line.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# define job status
dat$at_work <- dat$job %in% c(2, 3)
dat$at_work <- dat$job %in% c(2, 3) # define job status
```
]

.pull-right[
### Giving structure

- Use commented lines together with dashes to break up your file into easily readable chunks.
- RStudio automatically detects these chunks and turns them into sections in the script outline.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Input/output ---------------------

# input
c("data/survey2021.csv")

#  output
c("survey_2021_cleaned.RData",
  "resp_ids.csv")

# Load data ------------------------

# Plot data ------------------------
```

# Other stuff

.pull-left[
- Use **spaces** generously, but not too generously. Always put a space after a comma, never before, just like in regular English.
- Use `<-`, not `=`, for **assignment**.
- For **logical operators**, prefer `TRUE` and `FALSE` over `T` and `F`.
- To facilitate readability, **keep your lines short**. Strive to limit your code to about 80 characters per line.
- If a **function call is too long** to fit on a single line, use one line each for the function name, each argument, and the closing bracket.
- Use **pipes**. When you use them, they should always have a space before it, and should usually be followed by a new line.

**Spacing**

# FAQ

.pull-left[

<br>

**Q: How much time should I invest to learn the tidyverse?**

A: A week clearly is not enough. You will automatically practice more over the course of the semester. Coding is also self-learning, though. Look out for other tidyverse packages that sound interesting, and practice them!

**Q: Should I still learn base R?**

A: You are going to, automatically. All I've done is to nudge you to a certain preference. But base R is not evil. It's just a bit less accessible.
]

.pull-right[

<br>

**Q: Does the tidyverse also work for Big Data**

A: Sure! However, when dealing with large datasets, you might want to consider the [`data.table`](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/) package as an alternative to `dplyr`. Or just use [`dtplyr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/dtplyr), a `data.table` backend for dplyr that allows you to write dplyr code that is automatically translated to the equivalent, but usually much faster, data.table code.
  

**Q: What from the tidyverse should I learn next?**

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sample(tidyverse_packages(), 1)
```
